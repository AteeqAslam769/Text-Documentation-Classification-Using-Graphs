login building up the natural immune system building up the natural immune system for many of us this is the first time we have seen such widespread concern over illness and the proposed measures to combat itâ€” and the return to school for kids throughout the country doesnt exactly help matters while we can take precautions to avoid contracting disease once it enters our bodies its our own immune system that is left to fight the battle when such a battle ensues we want our internal army to have all the reinforcements it needs what exactly is the immune system simply put the immune system is an intricate network of compounds and cells that defend the body against harmful pathogens pathogens are microorganisms that cause disease of which there are five general types now when any of these foreign organisms enter our bodies an immune response is usually triggered however the timeliness and impact of this initial response depend on a number of factors immunity refers to how well our bodies can resist a particular pathogen there are three general types of immunity innate immunity innate or natural immunity is a type of general protection from disease that a person is born with even with no previous exposure to a harmful invader our bodies do a pretty good job of executing a satisfactory attack adaptive immunity adaptive or active immunity is protection that develops over the course of our lives when we encounter certain pathogens our immune cells have ways of remembering them allowing for a more swift response next time that same pathogen is encountered our adaptive immunity develops as we are exposed to disease or when we seek immunization through vaccination passive immunity passive immunity is provided when a person inherits protection from an outside source common examples of this include the temporary resistance babies acquire from the consumption of breast milk and the transfer of certain antibodies from one to another through gamma globulin injections antibodies to the rescue when pathogens enter the body specialized immune cells such as the bcell and tcell flag the substance as harmful prompting the production of a very large amount of specialized antibodies which are created uniquely to bind to the matching pathogens antibodies are proteins that essentially act as locksmiths creating various keys out of protein and sugar which adhere to and neutralize the harmful things that enter our bodies in addition to the antibodys role of deactivating the foreign substance its presence recruits other defense cells like a road flare pinned to the intruder resulting in a concentrated attack on the pathogen after an infection has been adequately fought these antibodies remain in our blood for a period of time depending on the pathogen they target some last for a lifetime while others last for a period of months when antibodies are present our immune system is armed and ready for another attack signs of immune system weakness it doesnt take a serious underlying condition to weaken our internal
