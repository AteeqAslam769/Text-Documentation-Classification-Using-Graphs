apr 12retrieval practice in undergraduate medical education by cindy nebelcover photo byonpixabay about eight months ago i took a career change and started a new role as director of learning services for a medical school in the first few weeks on the job i happily told the students about spacing retrieval practice concrete examples and dual coding as often as they would listen their eyes glazed over they smiled and nodded thanked me for my time but it was very clear to me that i wasnt having much of an impact eight months later ive learned so much about the tools language and strategies that medical students use and how those ideas can be adapted using effective strategies in what follows i hope to provide some ideas for any medical students reading this but to also discuss the lessons ive learned about the limitations of research and efficient not just effective learning background first some prior knowledge for the nonmedical folks reading med students you can skip this next paragraph image byonpixabay medical education is divided into undergraduate medical education ume which includes coursework supervised clinical rotations and specialty electives and graduate medical education gme which is residency and like their entry level job so ume is graduatelevel education postbachelors but called undergraduate for reasons ive yet to discover for the purposes of this blog im focused on phase 1 of ume  coursework for most medical schools preclinical coursework involves a series of short 48 weeksish courses on foundational topics of anatomy and physiology and organ modules eg cardiology brain and behavior hematology etc ume students have an enormous amount of information to learn in each of these courses in an extremely short amount of time many medical schools have switched to a passfail curriculum such that the goal is not to master 100 of the content but maybe 80 to stay safely above the passing threshold at the end of their coursework most students this varies some by medical school take their first medical licensing examination called step 1 the exam is 8 hours long and tests their basic science knowledge through high working memory demand questions that ask them to apply their knowledge to a series of vignettes usually requiring them to understand how information across systems are connected and problemsolving their way to an answer again the goal is not 100 on this exam but maybe 70 to be in very safe passing range the problem during a typical week of medical school students have many required activities these vary by school but might include lectures active learning sessions simulations etc in addition they have a long list of material that requires selfdirected learning there are simply not enough hours in the day for them to master the material they need learning strategies that are not only effective but efficient effective but inefficient a lot of the strategies we discuss take time it takes time literally to engage in quality spaced practice it takes time to
