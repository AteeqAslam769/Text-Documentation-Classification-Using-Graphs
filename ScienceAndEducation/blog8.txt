oct 20when revising read out loud by cindy nebel very frequently i give writers my students the advice that they should read their work out loud while revising i give this advice because it helps me to catch errors in writing but i did not have evidence to back up my advice… until now recently researchers examined whether reading out loud would help individuals to catch errors in writing more than reading silently or reading a disfluent font 1 whats a disfluent font you ask heres an example and its the one that was used in the study figure 1 from cited study why disfluency there has been some research looking into whether reading something disfluent like sans forgetica font could improve learning via that is when learning is more effortful it often results in better longterm retention most recently a metaanalysis 2 showed that disfluent font doesnt lead to much better learning but the hypothesis still might make sense for proofreading or revising see when font is disfluent you have to slow down to read it which means that we cant use those automatic processes that usually help us jump right over errors how did they test this at this point we have three groups participants who are reading passages silently aloud or in disfluent font while there were two experiments in the full study im describing the second experiment here as the results are a bit easier to understand while there are lots of different types of errors in real writing the researchers narrowed in on errors that are less likely for a standard spelling and grammar check to find these were some grammatical errors and some word choice errors each text that was read had only one to five errors so for the most part readers could read along without many errors and here is what they found image from cited source reading aloud was far better than reading silently or in a disfluent font whew  im giving good advice but this isnt the “best” part the researchers also asked people before the task which condition they thought would be best for proofreading and then after they had already proofread the passages they asked them again… which one do you think you did the best on now remember these individuals have all read these three types of passages over and over theyve been monitoring for errors on all of these passages surely surely they know they did better when reading aloud… image from cited source nope not a clue they rated reading silently and aloud the same both before they did the task understandable and after they had just performed so much better on the aloud passages what to me this posttask result is pretty incredible and shows us the power of beliefs and the human mind for many of the strategies that we promote the results are just counterintuitive rereadingfeelslike its working better than retrieval practice massing or blockingfeelslike youre learning more so than with
