 a blog to reflect share and learn  feb23 school ai is absolutely amazing  rises to top of my list february 23 2024 i started this school year with parent permission to usewith my 5th and 6th graders because being under 13 years of age they cannot access tools such atchatgptorquillbot which can be used with students ages 13 to 18 with parent permission the thengoogle bard now google gemini is for 18 years or older onlybing chat did not work out very wellbecause it worked on some student computers and not on others the worst part was that we needed to change search settings from very safe to moderate safety which should not be necessary i managed to help my students get feedback on their writing usingwhen bing chat did not work so we were able towrite a book with ai supportcuripodis a great option for use with students of all ages and i do use it still to engage students but i wanted an ai tool that students could use on their own when they need help and im busy helping others and their peers are also in need of help i also needed a chatbot for my math classes and we cannot afford khanmigo soand they did not provide the support i was looking for then i came acrossthat was made for kids of all ages requiring no signing up or signing inbyte was also helpful for my math students shortly after that i also came acrossdigcitinstitutes mundo ai chatbotthat was another safe tool for kids of all ages i also started trying outmagic school aiat that time but that tool was more for my use as a teacher and not something i could provide to my students directly they are coming out with magic student soon and i cant wait to see how that works andmundo was also pretty good at math support too beating out byte and mundo was a tool where teachers could quickly and easily create their own chatbots for whatever they neededmizou quickly became my new ai tool of choice for kids and it was pretty good at math support then someone turned me on toand that one has beaten outmizou heres whyâ€¦ first here is how school ai handled the first question about brads baseballs from the 5th grade bridges curriculum good start the chatbot asked me to calculate 72 x 9 i prompted it for help doing that it did what i was looking for gave me a way to multiply 72 times 9 without using the standard algorithm that throws off many students and does not promote reasoning through a problem to solve it school ai also took me there rather quickly and efficiently so i asked it the next question from a 6th grade textbook here school ai jumped to the solution without really prompting me or guiding me so i had to ask it how it got there im not sure how many students would do that
